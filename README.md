## Challenges Structure

Each challenge will have its own folder, named in the format `1-challenge-name`, `2-challenge-name`, and so on. Inside each folder, a `README.md` file will contain the challenge details, rules, and example inputs/outputs.

### Example Structure:

```
challenges/
├── 1-challenge-name
│   └── README.md
├── 2-challenge-name
│   └── README.md
└── 3-challenge-name
    └── README.md
```

Each `README.md` file should include:
- **Challenge Description**: A clear summary of the challenge.
- **Rules/Constraints**: Any specific requirements for solving the challenge.
- **Examples**: Sample inputs and expected outputs.
