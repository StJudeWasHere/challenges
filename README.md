## About

This repository holds the challenge solutions submitted by members of the wwwdev.cc. Each challenge will be organized by challenge number and name.

## Challenges Structure

Each challenge will have its own folder, named in the format `1-challenge-name`, `2-challenge-name`, and so on. Inside each folder, a `README.md` file will contain the challenge details, rules, and example inputs/outputs.

### Example Structure:

```
challenges/
├── 1-challenge-name
│   └── README.md
├── 2-challenge-name
│   └── README.md
└── 3-challenge-name
    └── README.md
```

Each `README.md` file should include:
- **Challenge Description**: A clear summary of the challenge.
- **Rules/Constraints**: Any specific requirements for solving the challenge.
- **Examples**: Sample inputs and expected outputs.

## How to Contribute

Challenges can be solved in any programming language unless specified otherwise. If you want to submit your solution to be included in the repository:

- Clone this repository.
- Create a subfolder with your files in the challenge you want to solve.
- Make a pull request.

Your subfolder should follow some conventions. It should start with the name of the programming language you used to solve the challenge, followed by your github username.
